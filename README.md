#**File Handling Tasks in Java**

In our Java project, we worked with basic file handling operations, including creating, modifying, renaming, and deleting files. We wrote and tested the code using a simple text editor like Notepad and ran it through a Java compiler using the command prompt. These tasks are very important in real applications, where programs need to manage files to store data, log information, or read user input. Here is a detailed explanation of each task and how we implemented it in our project.

1. Creating a File

The first task was to create a new file using Java. We used the File class and wrote code that checks if the file already exists. If not, it creates a new file using the .createNewFile() method. This is very useful when we want to store data from users or logs from a system. For example, a program might create a file to save daily records. We wrote this Java code in Notepad and saved it with a .java extension like CreateFile.java. Then we compiled and executed it using the command prompt. It was interesting to see how Java interacts with the file system in such a simple way.

2. Writing/Modifying a File

The second task was modifying or writing content into the file. We used FileWriter to write or update data inside the file. This can be used when we want to store user preferences, feedback, or any kind of text-based data. Using the .write() and .close() methods, we wrote some lines into our file. The good part about Java is that we can either append to the file or overwrite it, depending on how we initialize the FileWriter. This task is essential in applications like notepads or configuration editors.

3. Reading from a File

We also read the content using Scanner along with the File class. This allows us to take input from the file and use it for further processing, like loading user preferences or reading configuration settings. It helped us understand how file input can control application behavior.

4. Renaming a File

To rename a file in Java, we used the renameTo() method. This is helpful when files are updated, and we want to give them a new name based on the content or date. We renamed example.txt to renamed\_example.txt in our task. It's a simple but powerful feature.

5. Deleting a File

Lastly, we performed file deletion using the delete() method. This task is important to remove unwanted or temporary files after they are no longer needed. We used simple code that deletes the file and checks if the operation was successful.

Conclusion

In this project, using Java and Notepad, I learned how to create, modify, rename, and delete files using basic file handling classes. These tasks are essential for building any Java application that needs to store or manage data efficiently, and doing it through Notepad helped me understand the basics clearly, without using any advanced tools.#
